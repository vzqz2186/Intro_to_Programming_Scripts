Contact is a text-based story that gets its inspiration from the skit "White
People - Scene" from Logic's "The Increduble True Story" album and lore from
the videogame series "Mass Effect." The classic WASD controls are used to
explore the levels. Q can be used at any time to quit the game. The player
takes the roll of a communications officer from the Alliance serving at the
spaceship SSV Aquarius III. One day, you recieve a distress signal to your
communications console frome a sole survivor in another ship. Will you be able
to get him to safety or will he perish to an unknown beast? His life is on your
hands...
