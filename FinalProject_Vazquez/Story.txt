C: <<buzz>> ... Mayday, mayday. This is C... <<buzz>> ... from the SSV Aquarius
   I. The ship is in ...<<buzz>>... unknown specimen ...<<buzz>>... heavy
   casualties ...<<buzz>>... please respond.

U: This is Officer __________ from the SSV Aquarius III. I've received your
   distress signal.

C: Oh, thank God. You have to help me. There are some creatures outside.
   I don't know what they are but it has killed a lot of people. I'm trapped
   in Dorm 152 all by myself.

U: Okay, don't worry. Aquarius III will send some people to get you back to
   safety.

C: NO! No... Don't send anyone. These... things... will slaughter everyone on
   their way. They killed the toughest soldiers on the ship like they were
   nothing. Besides, I don't think announcing what happened here to people is a
   good idea.

U: Why is it not a good idea to inform other people?

C: It's too risky. As I said, this creatures mean business. If you send
   someone, they are not coming back.

U: Okay, I'll help you from here. What do I have to do?

C: Thank you so much! There is still one escape pod left. I can see it from the
   window here. I don't really know the way there though. I just need you to
   guide me there.

U: Alright. I need to download the map and access the security cameras of your
   ship first.

#ask for access to those things.

U: I couldn't get acccess to the cameras, so you will have to tell me what you
   see so I can guide you.

C: Okay, okay. I can do that.

U: Good. Let's get you out of that room first.

#after opening the door of the room

C: I'm out. I'm in a hallway. Where to now? Left or right?

#after deciding which way to go.

#If going left

#If going right

D: Thanks for playing the first version. The full version is currently under
