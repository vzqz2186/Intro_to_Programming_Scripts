C: Officer __________, I just entered a main room... and there is one of them
   here! I can't let it see me if I want to survive this!

U: Can you describe it? How does it look like?

C: Tall. Grey skin. Humanoid form. It has a hump but I'm not sure if it is 
   because of its armor or if it is biological. Looks a lot like a bird. It
   actually looks a lot like a human with bird-like traits.

U: Does it look hostile?

C: It seems like it's patrolling but I don't think it knows that I'm here.

U: Alright try to move slowly and quietly to where I tell you to go.

<<<MAP SIGNAL LOST>>> <<<MAP SIGNAL LOSS>>>

U: Uhhhh, we may have a problem here. I don't have the scans of the room
   anymore. I lost signal.

C: WHAT?! WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?! I DON'T WANT TO DIE!

U: Stay calm, you are going to describe me your surroundings and I'll tell you
   where to go.

C: (sigh) ...okay... here we go... please, don't let me die...
