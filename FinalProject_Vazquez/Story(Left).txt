C: We are almost there, Officer __________, we are probably a couple of rooms
   behind.

U: I still don't know who you are.

C: It is better that way. Actually, there's a reason why I asked you not to
   send anyone here besides not risking their lives.

U: What is it?

C: The Alliance can't find out I'm alive. I need to dissapear. Our precense
   in this sector, something didn't like it. A ship found us.It is not human,
   or at least it doesn't look like it. We tried to communicate with it but it
   attacked. We got boarded and those things started fighting our men, we
   didn't last long. They have taken over the ship. They are in the command
   room. They have access to all of our information. Our ships, our fleet...

U: Earth... You know protocol states that in case the data center is
   compromised, the ship needs to be destroyed, right?

C: Yes. And I also know that it's against protocol to approach an unidentified
   object without the Alliance clearance. Breaking that rule has extremely
   serious consequences. I don't want to go to jail. I can't let my family's
   name to be stained with such a shame. It is better if I go off the radar in
   one of the colonies in Paradise or Eden Prime.

U: I have to destroy that ship NOW. This may be a matter of human survival!

C: PLEASE WAIT! At least let me get out in the escape pod first. Please,
   Officer __________, have mercy!

U: (sigh) I'm breaking many rules here, so if we're doing this, let's do it
   quick.

C: THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU! Your sacrifices will not go in vain, I
   promise.

C: I found another door. The button to open this door is... not here?

U: We have to find it then.
